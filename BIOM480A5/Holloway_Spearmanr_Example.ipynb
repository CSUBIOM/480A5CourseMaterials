    "The Spearman correlation test uses the Spearman correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction between two ranked variables [1]. First, data needs to be ranked, with the highest value being assigned a \"1\" and the lowest value a \"10\". With the ranked values, the Spearman correlation coefficient is calculated with the following formula:\n",

    "Figure 1: Spearman correlation coefficient equation, given no rank ties.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this formula, the Spearman correlation coefficient, r, can be between +1 and -1. +1 showcases a perfect association of ranks, and -1 showcases a perfect negative association of ranks. Spearman correlation test can evaluate the association of non-linear data and assesses monotonic relationships. \n",

    "The above figure represents a possible graph that can be plotted and evaluated through a Spearman correlation test. This data takes X and Y variables that aren't independent/dependent pairs but could be like two different subject test scores, ranks them, and plots the rank pairs. The above equation evaluates the pairs to determine a Spearman correlation coefficient. The Spearman correlation coefficient for this dataset is 1, which showcases a perfect positive association of the variables. This data is an example of a monotonic relationship. \n",
