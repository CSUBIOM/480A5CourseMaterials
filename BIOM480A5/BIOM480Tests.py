# This file is part of the BIOM480A5 course discussion. 
# Each student will present on a different topic related to statistical tests.
# The goal is to create a function for each topic that can be used to perform the test.
# Each student will create a function with the following format:
# def function_name(parameters):
#     '''
#     Description of the function and its parameters.
#     Parameters:
#     parameter1 : type
#         Description of parameter1.
#     parameter2 : type
#         Description of parameter2.
#     Returns:
#     return_value : type
#         Description of return_value.
#     Example:
#     >>> function_name(parameter1, parameter2)
#     >>> print(return_value)
#     Notes:
#     Additional notes about the function.
#     '''
# The function should be able to be called from the command line or from another script.

# Please enter your tests below in the correct location (look for your name). 
# If you need to add a module, please do so at the top.

import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Example will present on the topic of t-test, creating function named 'ttest'
def ttest(a, b):
    '''
    Perform a t-test on two independent samples.
    Parameters:
    a : array_like
        First sample.
    b : array_like
        Second sample.
    Returns:
    t_stat : float
        The calculated t-statistic.
    p_value : float
        The two-tailed p-value.

    Example:
    >>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> b = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    >>> t_stat, p_value = ttest(a, b)
    >>> print(t_stat)
    0.0
    >>> print(p_value)
    0.3465935070873343
    
    Notes:
    This function assumes that the two samples have equal variances.
    The p-value is calculated using the two-tailed test.
    '''
    # Calculate the means and standard deviations
    mean_a = np.mean(a)
    mean_b = np.mean(b)
    std_a = np.std(a, ddof=1)
    std_b = np.std(b, ddof=1)
    n_a = len(a)
    n_b = len(b)
    # Calculate the t-statistic
    t_stat = (mean_a - mean_b) / np.sqrt((std_a**2 / n_a) + (std_b**2 / n_b))
    # Calculate the degrees of freedom
    df = n_a + n_b - 2
    # Calculate the p-value
    p_value = 2 * (1 - np.abs(t_stat) / np.sqrt(df))
    return t_stat, p_value

def dagostino(data):
    '''
    Perform D'Agostino and Pearson's test for normality and return detailed diagnostics.

    Parameters:
    data : array_like
        A one-dimensional array of sample data.

    Returns:
    results : dict
        Dictionary containing:
        - 'k2_statistic': combined test statistic
        - 'p_value': p-value of the test
        - 'skewness': sample skewness
        - 'kurtosis': sample excess kurtosis
        - 'z_skew': skewness Z-score
        - 'z_kurt': kurtosis Z-score

    Example:
    >>> data = [-1.83, -0.58, 0.70, -1.35, 0.89, -0.18, 2.88, 0.94, -0.43, 0.27]
    >>> result = dagostino(data)
    >>> for key, val in result.items():
            print(f"{key}: {val:.4f}")

    Notes:
    This function evaluates both skewness and kurtosis to test for normality using the 
    D'Agostino and Pearson test. It provides individual shape measures as well 
    as the combined test statistic and p-value.
    '''
    # Calculate skewness and kurtosis
    skew_val = skew(data)
    kurt_val = kurtosis(data)  # excess kurtosis by default

    # Get Z-scores for skewness and kurtosis
    z_skew, _ = skewtest(data)
    z_kurt, _ = kurtosistest(data)

    # Combined K² test
    k2_stat, p_value = normaltest(data)

    # Return all results as a dictionary
    return {
        'K2_statistic': k2_stat,
        'p_value': p_value,
